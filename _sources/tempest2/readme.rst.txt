TempEst2
========

TempEst 2/SCHEMA is “TEMPerature ESTimation, version 2, using Seasonal
Conditions Historical Estimation with Modeled daily Anomaly”. It
estimates stream water temperature at a point, for streams of any size,
using a data-driven model based on satellite remote sensing data.

This repository contains the model source code (``model.R``), Google
Earth Engine data retrieval script (``eeretrieval.py``) and example data
collection points (``datapts.py``), and R Notebooks demonstrating model
usage (``demo.Rmd``) and a large set of model performance tests
(``validation.Rmd``), used to make the performance claims reproducible.
In addition, the HydroShare data (see below) includes knitted output of
both Notebooks (``demo.pdf``, ``validation.pdf``) and the full
training/testing dataset (``AllData.csv``, ``ExtData.csv`` including
maximum temperatures).

In addition to the GEE data retrieval script, there is a utility script
in Python, ``points_above.py``, for generating lists of coordinates in
the correct format, evenly-spaced above given target site(s) - this is
useful for quickly generating study points over rivers of interest.

Quick Guide
-----------

Dependencies in R: ``tidyverse``, ``fields``. Additional dependencies
for Google Earth Engine data retrieval: Python with the GEE API
configured.

Using a Trained Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A pre-trained model is available in Releases as ``model.rda``.
``load("model.rda")`` will load a function called ``model``. The
argument to ``model`` is a data frame with columns:

-  id (site ID; character)
-  lon (longitude; decimal degrees East)
-  lat (latitude; decimal degrees North)
-  day (Julian day; integer)
-  date (as an R Date)
-  elevation (mean in a 500-m radius about point of interest; meters)
-  water, shrubland, grassland, barren (land cover, abundance in a 500-m
   radius about point of interest; unitless, m2/m2)
-  lst (land surface temperature, daily daytime mean in a 500-m radius
   about point of interest; Celsius)
-  humidity (specific humidity, daily mean in a 500-m radius about point
   of interest; unitless, kg/kg)

Using this data frame as the argument to ``model``, the function will
return the same data frame with three or five new columns:

-  temp.mod (modeled daily mean temperature; Celsius)
-  temp.doy (modeled day-of-year mean temperature; Celsius)
-  temp.anom (modeled temperature anomaly relative to day-of-year mean;
   Celsius)
-  temp.plus (modeled maximum temperature relative to day-of-year mean;
   Celsius)
-  temp.max (modeled maximum daily temperature; Celsius)

``temp.mod`` = ``temp.doy`` + ``temp.anom``.

These three (five) columns are the final output, and can be used to
assess actual estimated temperature (``temp.mod``); typical seasonal
conditions (``temp.doy``), such as to assess general long-term behavior;
and departure from typical seasonal conditions (``temp.anom``), such as
to assess heat waves or other extremes.

Retrieving Prediction Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Suitable prediction data can be retrieved in any way, but a script for
retrieving the data from Google Earth Engine is included. In
``eeretrieval.py``, the function ``getAllTimeseries`` will retrieve data
for specified points and dates to Google Drive. Points are specified
according to the example format in ``datapts.py``: a list of
``[[[longitude, latitude], "point id"], ...]``.

Generating Evenly-Spaced Points
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You’ll need a list of points of interest (USGS gage IDs, COMIDs, or
coordinates - all in the same format), your desired maximum number of
points per river, and a corresponding list of base IDs (and can
optionally specify the resolution; the default is 1,000).

ID format:

-  USGS gage: ``"USGS-<ID>"`` with ``site_type="usgs"``
-  COMID: just the COMID string with ``site_type="comid"``
-  Coordinates: (lon, lat) in decimal degrees with
   ``site_type="coordinates"``

Then, just run
``points_above.points_above_all([<site ids>], <site type>, <max points per river>, <resolution>, [<base ids>])``
to get a list in the suitable format.

Example for Clear Creek and Sagehen Creek:

``points_above_all(["USGS-10343500", "USGS-06719505"], "usgs", 50, 1000, ["Sagehen", "ClearCreek"])``

Training a Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using all default options, ``full.schema()`` returns a function for
training a model. This function’s argument is a data frame similar to
above, but with one additional column: ``temperature``, the observed
temperature (daily mean, Celsius) for training.
``full.schema()(training data)`` then returns a function like ``model``
above. A typical approach to model training is for ``id`` to be set to
training ga(u)ge IDs, such as the USGS stream temperature gage network,
so that spatial observations can readily be linked to observed
temperatures. Prediction data and observations are retrieved
independently of the training observations, but an example for USGS
gages is included in ``demo.Rmd``.

``full.schema`` provides some additional options.

First, by default the model is trained with the two kriging models
included, but the ``full.schema`` function itself is a generic framework
for linking a seasonality (``sche``) and anomaly (``ma``) component, and
these can be specified separately, e.g. to test a different approach
without changing any of the infrastructure.

The third argument to ``full.schema`` is ``rtn.model``, which is
``FALSE`` by default. If it is set to ``TRUE``, then, instead of
returning a prediction function,
``full.schema(rtn.model=TRUE)(training data)`` will return a list of
model components. This is useful to examine model behaviors directly,
such as extracting coefficients from the kriging models. This is shown
in ``demo.Rmd``.

If the fourth argument to ``full.schema``, ``use.max``, is ``TRUE``
(default ``FALSE``), then the model will be trained to predict both mean
and maximum temperature, requiring a ``temperature.max`` column in the
training data.
