TempEst-NEXT
============

TempEst-NEXT (stream temperature estimation: near-term expected
temperatures) is a statistical model to hindcast and forecast daily
stream temperature for watersheds without local calibration data. It
uses site climate and geography data to estimate the coefficients for
the `TempEst-NEWT <https://github.com/mines-ciroh/TempEst-NEWT>`__
calibrated statistical model.

NEWT and NEXT are part of the TempEst family of models, including
`TempEst 1 <https://github.com/mines-ciroh/tempest1>`__ for remote
sensing-based monthly mean temperatures and `TempEst
2 <https://github.com/mines-ciroh/TempEst2/>`__ for remote sensing-based
daily mean and maximum temperatures, both in ungaged watersheds. TempEst
2 and NEXT have similar functionality, but TempEst-NEXT is capable of
forecasting and disturbance modeling, while TempEst 2 is only for
historical estimation (but is much faster and uses less data). TempEst
1/2 are intended for fast analyses of large-domain historical patterns,
while NEWT/NEXT are more focused on in-depth analysis of changes over
time, as well as forecasting.

Quick Start
-----------

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install from PyPI: ``pip install tempest-next``. The installed module is
called NEXT: ``import NEXT``.

Data Preparation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**NOTE: Data retrieval is currently a bit spotty because of API changes
and other upstream chaos, as the Daymet API that was used is no longer
available. NLDAS2 data retrieval (``weather="nldas"``) may or may not
work. HRRR data retrieval should work (argument: ``weather="hrrr"``).
The** `HydroShare
repository <https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/abdb4e52147e408f9e328a5ba2a155f8/>`__
**includes data to replicate the analysis, so the automatic data
retrieval tools are not required for testing.**

TempEst-NEXT provides automatic tools for data retrieval, for example:
``NEXT.data.full_data("-105.1235:40.5723", start="2020", end="2024", site_type="coordinates")``.
You can also provide an input data frame. Required columns are
``["id", "tmax", "prcp", "vp",             "area", "elev_min", "elev", "slope",             "wetland", "developed", "ice_snow", "water",             "canopy", "ws_canopy",             "date", "day"]``,
with the addition of a “temperature” column if you wish to train a
model.

Column details:

-  id: site ID
-  day: Julian day of year
-  tmax: daily max air temperature (C)
-  prcp: daily mean precipitation (mm/day)
-  vp: daily mean vapor pressure (Pa)
-  area: watershed area (m2) - note *m*\ 2, not km2
-  elev_min: minimum watershed elevation (m), i.e. pour point elevation
-  elev: mean watershed elevation (m)
-  slope: mean watershed slope (m/m)
-  wetland, developed, ice_snow, water: land cover abundances in the
   watershed as a proportion (e.g., wetland=0.2)
-  canopy, ws_canopy: mean forest canopy cover as a proportion (e.g.,
   0.8) for the riparian zone and the whole watershed, respectively

Model Generation and Execution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NEXT generates a model from a data frame with the appropriate input
data.

From there, there are three ways to use the resulting NEWT model:

-  For convenience, NEXT can silently generate and run the model, then
   just return the output timeseries without explicitly returning the
   model. This allows you to use NEXT itself as the model directly,
   rather than as a NEWT-generator with extra steps.
-  NEXT can also return the generated NEWT model as-is. For using that,
   refer to
   `TempEst-NEWT <https://github.com/mines-ciroh/TempEst-NEWT>`__
   documentation.
-  Another convenience approach is to simply write the NEWT model as a
   configuration file, rather than returning a model. This is useful to
   prepare a model for later.

NEXT can also predict coefficients without building a model, which can
be used to look at stream thermal regimes in general.

Design Overview
---------------

The task of NEXT is to create standalone NEWT models. It does not run
anything itself, and NEWT is, in turn, independent of NEXT. This can be
used to generate and run models right away in Python, or to export model
configuration files for later use (e.g., in nextgen).

NEXT implements the dynamic SCHEMA approach (SCHEMA = “Seasonal
Conditions Historical Estimation with Modeled daily Anomaly”; see
TempEst 2). The basic framework is to estimate (1) seasonal conditions,
used to predict day-of-year mean, and (2) the sensitivity of stream
temperature to weather variation, used to predict the difference between
actual temperature and day-of-year mean. The classic SCHEMA approach in
TempEst 2 is stationary; TempEst-NEXT modifies this to allow the model
coefficients to shift with changing watershed climate.

NEXT will process an input dataset to estimate model coefficients and
will then return a NEWT model object. It will also create and apply an
appropriate modification engine to handle dynamic conditions.
