TempEst Modeling
============================================

The TempEst (stream TEMPerature ESTimation) models are a suite of river temperature models focused on sites without local monitoring data (ungaged modeling). At one-kilometer resolution, TempEst models provide the fastest available estimates of historical stream temperatures at daily (including mean and maximum) and monthly timesteps. This website includes documentation and references for the TempEst models and related projects. A notable spinoff is libSCHEMA, a Python package which provides a generic implementation of the SCHEMA modeling framework (see TempEst 2 reference) - you provide the model logic, libSCHEMA handles all the computation details (including a Basic Model Interface implementation for use with the NextGen National Water Model Framework).
